Problem Statement 
Meeting deadlines, maintaining high productivity, and planning daily activities all depend on effective task management.  Nonetheless, a lot of people rely on memory or take handwritten notes, which can result in misplaced information, missed assignments, and ineffective time management.  This demonstrates the need for an organized, dependable, and user-friendly system that assists users in tracking, organizing, and recording their tasks.
 The objective is to develop a Python-based To-Do List Manager that makes it simple for users to add tasks, along with their categories, priority levels, and due dates.  Users should be able to update, remove, and mark tasks as finished using the application.  Additionally, it ought to send out reminders for tasks that are past due. The system must be user-friendly, menu-driven, and able to save task data, offering a solid solution for effective task management.


Scope 
The To-Do List Manager is a simple console-based tool designed to help you keep track of your daily tasks with ease. You can add tasks with important details like due dates, priorities, and categories, so nothing important slips through the cracks. It lets you view your tasks, edit or delete them, and mark them as complete to stay up-to-date on what’s done and what’s left. Plus, it can remind you when tasks are due or overdue, so you never miss a deadline. To help you see how you’re progressing, it summarizes completed and pending tasks. Your task list can also be saved to a file, letting you pick up right where you left off. This project is great for learning basic Python skills like working with lists, loops, handling text, and managing input/output. It keeps things straightforward, without any fancy features like cloud storage, graphics, or mobile apps.
